# Generate Calendar

## DescripciÃ³n ğŸ“„

Every year I have to look for a calendar to print out since I like to organize myself that way. This year I decided that instead of wasting time looking for it, I was going to create it myself, so I made this project to generate the annual calendar by months. Just enter the year you want and it will generate the calendar for that year.
