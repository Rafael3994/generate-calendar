# Generate Calendar

## DescripciÃ³n ðŸ“„

Every year I have to look for a calendar to print out, since I like to organize myself that way. This year I decided that instead of wasting time looking for it, I was going to create it myself, so I made this project to generate the annual calendar by months. Just enter the year you want, and it will generate the calendar for that year.

### Deploy ðŸ”¥
```
https://generate-calendar.onrender.com/
```

In the page, to generate the calendar, put the year and the different events if you want it. Also, you can download a template to add the events and import this file with them to get it dynamically.

1. Add events to the calendar using a string in the command. In the name of the event, you can use emojis.
    ```bash
   npm run start {year} '["{day}/{month}/{name_event}"'

   example:  npm run start 2024 '["1/1/ðŸ’ª First day of the year ðŸ”¥"]'
   ```
